/* use inquirer to ask the user for a number that will represent the pokemon id,
 and then use axios to make a request to fetch data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/:id to get info about the pokemon with that id.

    Log the name of the pokemon with that id.

    Use a single catch method to handle if the axios request gives back a 404 - in this case, log a user friendly error saying that the pokemon does not exist.

Hint: There are currently no pokemon in the database with IDs between 19999 and 29999 so you can use a number between these to test that your catch method is working.*/

const inquirer = require("inquirer");
const axios = require("axios");

// 1 use inquirer to prompt user for a number ID
//  save number to variable/ return number
//  request data from pokemon API and dynamically match poke key
// log pokemon that matches ID

const question = [{ type: "input", name: "ID", message: "Enter your PokeD" }];
